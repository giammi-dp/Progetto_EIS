Both lesions were in size and exhibited homogeneous hyperintensity on diffusionweighted MRI . The primary consideration in this case was brain abscess. Due to the small size of the lesion, neurosurgical aspiration was planned in case the causative pathogen could not be identified by blood culture or treated by antibiotics. After blood cultures were obtained, empirical treatment with intravenous meropenem administration was initiated. Levetiracetam was started for seizure prophylaxis. Although the causative pathogen was not identified by blood culture, the lesion sizes reduced remarkably following antibiotic treatment, and left hemiparesis was improved. Therefore, neurosurgical aspiration was not performed. However, his left hemiparesis worsened weeks after treatment initiation. Cranial MRI revealed that the mass lesion in the right frontal lobe was slightly enlarged and the surrounding vasogenic edema was exacerbated . Blood cultures were taken again, and then neurosurgical aspiration was performed. Stereotactic needle aspiration of the lesion in the right frontal lobe yielded purulent discharge, leading to a confirmed diagnosis of brain abscesses for both lesions. S. intermedius growth was detected only in the purulent fluid culture and not in the blood cultures. There was a considerable reduction in the lesion sizes after surgical drainage and antibiotic treatment based on antibioticsensitivity test . The origin of the brain abscesses could not be identified even after several examinations, including intraoral examination and panoramic radiography . However, during treatment for lung cancer, the patient had undergone tooth extraction of the right mandibular second molar harboring apical periodontitis approximately months before admission. Because S. intermedius, an indigenous oral bacterial species, was detected by the purulent fluid culture, oral infection or dental manipulation was considered as the possible cause of brain abscesses. At months after the surgery, the left hemiparesis had disappeared. Approximately months after the surgery, the lesions had disappeared and the surrounding vasogenic edema had partially improved on the noncontrast MRI . Cancer treatment had to be interrupted for several months to treat the brain abscesses, and the patients medical condition worsened rapidly due to cancer progression. Approximately months after the surgery, pembrolizumab was administered for months, followed by chemotherapy for month due to a temporary improvement in his medical condition. However, he died months after the surgery, unable to control the lung cancer that had grown rapidly when cancer treatment was interrupted.

Carbamazepine administration slightly alleviated the pain but did not eliminate it; therefore, the patient was referred to our department for further evaluation and treatment. Neurological examination revealed leftsided deafness, left Bruns nystagmus, bilateral papilledema, and paroxysmal electric pain in all right trigeminal nerve divisions. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI showed a heterogeneously enhanced mass measuring x in the left cerebellopontine angle CPA and a tight cerebellopontine cistern of the right CPA . For further evaluation of right facial pain, the bilateral BR was obtained using bipolar stimulation by placing the cathode in the supraorbital crease and the anode above the cathode. Recording electrodes were placed on the lower eyelids, with a reference electrode near each lateral cantus. Stimulation with ms squarewave pulses was measured using Neuropack X1 Nihon Kohden, Japan. The latency of the R1 and R2 waves ipsilateral and contralateral to the stimulus and the difference between the R1 latency ipsilateral and contralateral to the lesion were measured. We referred to previous study indices of normal neurophysiology values expressed as the mean SD in ms: R1, ; R2 ipsilateral, ; R2 contralateral, ; the difference between right and left R1, ; and mean upper limit, SD. The BR was recorded immediately after the neurological examination. Preoperative evaluation of the BR showed a delayed R1 latency after stimulation of the right supraorbital nerve, despite a normal R2 latency and normal R1 and R2 latencies after right and left supraorbital nerve stimulation, respectively, suggesting neuropathy in the afferent pathway between the right REZ and the principal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve in the pons . The tumor was removed using the left retrosigmoid approach under general anesthesia with auditory brainstem response ABR, motorevoked potential MEP, and sensoryevoked potential monitoring. The MEP was used to monitor brainstem injury. During surgery, the preservation of facial nerve function was confirmed using a neural integrity monitor. The ABR and MEP did not change postoperatively. Finally, complete tumor resection was performed, while avoiding facial nerve and brainstem dysfunction. The tumor was diagnosed as a grade schwannoma based on histopathological examination the World Health Organization criteria. Because his right facial pain disappeared days after surgery, carbamazepine was gradually tapered off until completely discontinued on the 45th postoperative day.

The neurological examination was clinically unremarkable. The MRI demonstrated a lobulated mass within the third ventricle, with mildly increased signal on T2 weighted imaging, isodensity on T1 weighted imaging, and no restricted diffusion. There was absent cerebral spinal fluid CSF flow through the cerebral aqueduct and no dilation of the fourth ventricle. The patient underwent endoscopic exploration with biopsy of the mass protruding through the foramen of Monroe followed by septum pellucidotomy and ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion. The followup MRI in March showed subtle tumor growth, and the patient experienced increased tumor size and recurrence of headaches. A multidisciplinary was held, and the potential surgical morbidity associated with an approach to the third ventricle led to consideration of medical treatment. In consideration of the tumor growth and the presence of a BRAF p.V600E mutation, the patient was suggested to take the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib. She commenced dabrafenib at twice daily in July . The MRI performed months later in October demonstrated a significant reduction in tumor size, from x mm to x mm. The histology was consistent with a World Health Organization WHO grade I glioma, which is a type of brain tumor. The tissue sample showed the presence of dysplastic ganglion cells with large neurons, abnormal localization, and loss of cytoarchitectural organization. There was also a neoplastic glial component with no necrosis seen.

She underwent treatment according to the guidelines following the closure of the European SIOPCNSGCT trial, with courses of intensive PEI chemotherapy cisplatin, etoposide, and ifosfamide followed by focal Gy radiotherapy to the pituitary area only. MRI imaging at that stage showed a good response with only a small nonenhancing mm residual that was not felt to be resectable . At years of age, and years following the end of treatment, routine surveillance MRI demonstrated an asymptomatic relapse outside the radiotherapy field, with nodular enhancing cystlike lesions posterior and inferior to the corpus callosum and involving the septum pellucidum , measuring mm x mm x mm. Spinal imaging and CSF cytology were clear. Repeat AFP tumor markers were negative serum kUL and CSF kUL. Serum and CSF HCG demonstrated very slightly raised levels of IUL and IUL reference range IUL, respectively, but below the threshold of IUL to be considered secreting on the European trial protocols SIOPCNSGCT and SIOPCNSGCTII and guidelines. Remaining CSF and leftover serum were stored for microRNA quantification. A biopsy was performed, which confirmed germinoma only, consistent with the very mildly elevated HCG levels due to HCG production from syncytiotrophoblast cells within the germinoma. Serum and CSF miR371a3p quantification at the time of relapse revealed levels of and , respectively , consistent with levels observed in patients with proven intracranial malignant GCTs.

However, the right retroocular pain gradually worsened and became in intensity. During this time, he also developed rightsided ptosis and diplopia with associated nausea and vomiting. His medical history was significant for diabetes mellitus, end stage renal disease status post combined pancreatic and renal transplant years ago on tacrolimus, prednisone, and mycophenolate, coronary artery disease and left shoulder Merkel cell carcinoma MCC T2 N1 M0 stage IIIB with metastasis to the left axilla that was resected months prior to his presentation. At the time of his initial diagnosis of MCC, patient refused chemotherapy because of the risk of transplant rejection and he only received local radiotherapy. In terms of surgical history, he had right cataract surgery year ago. His family history was significant for father with a stroke and mother with hypertension and renal disease. He never smoked and drank three glasses of wine per week. He did not use illicit drugs. He was a retired laboratory technician at a particle board plant. His home medications included amlodipine, aspirin, carvedilol, cholecalciferol, cyanocobalamin, doxazosin, magnesium oxide, mycophenolate, tacrolimus, albuterol, amoxicillin, atorvastatin, cetirizine, clonidine, clopidogrel, furosemide, levothyroxine, lisinopril, mometasone, multiple vitamin, prednisone, and ranitidine. On physical exam, vital signs were BP , pulse , respiratory rate , SpO2 . There was complete rightsided ptosis he was unable to open it, with complete right eye ophthalmoplegia. The right pupil was dilated, mm in size and fixed. Shining light to the right pupil constricted the left pupil. Left pupil was mm in size and reactive to light, but shining light into the left pupil did not constrict the right pupil. The left eye had complete abduction paralysis ; Video S1 in Supplementary Material. Visual acuity was OD, OS. Intraocular pressures were normal. Proptosis was not present. Dilated fundus exam showed temporal pallor of the disk in the right eye, and slight pallor of the disk in the left eye. Pinprick was mildly impaired in the right V1 and left V3 distributions. The rest of the neurological exam was unremarkable. Brain MRI with contrast months prior to his presentation did not reveal any abnormality. Differential diagnosis on admission included multiple cranial neuropathies secondary to TolosaHunt syndrome, cavernous sinus thrombosis, infection, granulomatous process or neoplasm, especially in the setting of MCC. Brain MRI showed infiltrative, peripherally enhancing tumor centered within the clivus with soft tissue extension into the cavernous sinus . Brain MRV was performed without contrast due to concern for his transplanted kidney function and the cavernous sinus was not well visualized. CT of the chest showed left axillary and left low cervical lymphadenopathy but negative for lung masses. He was started on Dexamethasone q6 hours to reduce tumor inflammation. Biopsy of the clival mass was performed with stereotactic, stealth CTguided bilateral endoscopic sphenoidotomy and partial ethmoidectomy. The posterior vomer and intersinus septum were removed within the sphenoid and biopsies were taken from the sphenoid mass seen along the floor. HE slides of the biopsy showed a small round blue cell tumor. Immunuohistochemical slides showed the tumor was positive for CD56, cytokeratin CAM perinuclear dotlike pattern, and cytokeratin perinuclear dotlike pattern. The tumor was negative for TTF, leukocyte common antigen LCA, S, and melanA . These findings were consistent with metastatic MCC. Further culture revealed colonization with Scopulariopsis species for which he was started on Posaconazole. He was started on palliative radiation therapy and he declined chemotherapy. Repeat MRI in month and CT scan months later did not reveal progression of the clival metastasis, but new metastatic lesions were found in the cervical spine involving C2, C3, C5, and C6 vertebral bodies. He was put on a cervical collar, but no further surgical or radiation therapy was performed as the patient was asymptomatic. Hospice was considered but the patient declined due to the need to stop his antirejection medications. At the time of submission of this manuscript, months after the initial discovery of the Merkel cell metastasis to the clivus, the patient remained alive. Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare but aggressive cutaneous neuroendocrine tumor. Our case is unique in that the patient presented with right III, IV, V1, VI and left V3, VI cranial nerve palsies without proptosis, mimicking TolosaHunt syndrome or bilateral cavernous sinus thrombosis. This is the first case showing distant MCC metastasis to the clivus with invasion of the cavernous sinuses. His presentation with complete right ptosis, fixed and dilated pupil along with impairment of all extraocular movement of the right eye is unique. The only case report of metastatic MCC involving the cavernous sinus was by Chang et al.. However, that case presented only with retroorbital pain and hemifacial, hemitongue numbness. In addition, the primary site of the MCC was on the face years prior to his presentation, with subsequent perineural spread to the brain and leptomeningeal dissemination. Clivus is a part of the cranium at the skull base sitting adjacent to the sphenoid sinuses and cavernous sinuses. The abducens nerves tracks along the clivus and a tumor within the clival space can often cause abducens nerve palsies. This patient presented with bilateral abducens nerve palsy, which is compatible with the clival metastasis. The infiltration into the cavernous sinuses caused right CN III, IV, V1. The left V3 nerve can be secondary to the clival mass or to extension of the cavernous sinus tumor infiltration since V3 is located adjacent to both structures D. Merkel cell carcinoma brain metastases typically occur after a mean period of months. The patient presented here was diagnosed and treated for MCC just months prior to his presentation. The growth of his MCC metastasis was also rapid. Brain MRI with contrast months prior to his ocular symptoms did not show any sign of metastasis. He progressed rapidly within weeks of symptom onset and his clinical picture was not concerning enough for an ophthalmologist who examined him weeks prior to his presentation.",0.008056740736773,0.1180604465412015,0.7845401763916016,0.2836317,0.2660028449502133,0.047008547008547,0.12375533428165

Pathology confirmed glioblastoma WHO grade IV with primitive neuroectodermal tumorlike components MGPNET Figure 2ad. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated abundant GFAP immunoreactivity and frequent p53 nuclear staining. Fluorescence insitu hybridization FISH analysis was negative for MYC rearrangement, but did confirm extra copies of the MYC region in of the tumor nuclei. MIB nuclear labeling approached in solid component regions of the mass with abundant EGFR expression. 1p 19q were intact. Isocitrate dehydrogenase IDH1 was wild type, and unmethylated MGMT was observed. Due to the PNETlike component of the tumor, MRI of the spinal axis was performed and was without evidence of drop metastasis. Subsequent treatment with radiation therapy and concurrent temozolomide chemotherapy was completed. Twelve weeks after the initial resection and post radiation therapytemozolomide, surveillance MRI scan revealed multiple new enhancing foci within the left frontal lobe . Due to the MGMT unmethylated status and the areas of new enhancement, open resection was performed, with pathology demonstrating cortex and white matter with very mild hypercellularity; no obvious tumor was recognized . Chemotherapy was continued. Seven weeks later and prior to his next planned MRI scan, the patient presented to the emergency department with acute onset of worsening headaches, nausea, vomiting, and lefthand weakness. He proceeded to develop status epilepticus. MRI brain revealed a diffusion restricting subdural collection overlying the prior craniotomy site . Considering the possibility for empyema, the patient was taken to the operating room for evacuation with intraoperative inspection of the subdural space revealing a thick, gelatinous mass adherent to the pia mater and invading the brain parenchyma. Biopsy demonstrated PNETlike only recurrence of the previously treated MGPNET . The small blue cell tumor component was histologically identical to the original MGPNET tumor. Due to mixedglial nature of the original tumor, biomarker molecular profiling was performed to assess the molecular characteristics of the tumor to determine chemotherapy sensitivity and provide targeted treatment. Considering that gliomas can exhibit multiple histologic and molecular subtypes with different clinical phenotypes and responsiveness to treatment, molecular profile testing provides the ability to evaluate tumor cell genetic characteristics and biomarkers. Specifically, molecular profiling evaluates gene amplification, deletion, and methylationspecific PCR to determine MGMT promoter methylation status and FISH for 1p and 19q deletion status. Though not routinely performed at our institution on gliomas demonstrating a homogenous histology, this study can be obtained and analyzed at an outside facility to assist in developing focused treatment regimens for mixedgliomas. In our patient, Caris Life Sciences comprehensive molecular tumor profiling test was conducted and included analysis of DNA, RNA, and proteins utilizing immunohistochemistry, insitu hybridization, nextgeneration sequencing, and pyrosequencing techniques. Based on molecular testing , chemotherapeutic agents with potential or lack of benefit have been suggested in clinical trials. In our patient, biomarker were positive for PTEN, TOPO1, and TOP2A; chemotherapeutic agents with potential benefit included carboplatin, cisplastin, and irinotecan. Because PNET is typically treated with platinumbased chemotherapy, studies confirmed MGMT unmethylated status and demonstrated potential sensitivity to platinumbased chemotherapy. In addition, biomarker demonstrated topoisomerase activity. Given these findings and that PNET is traditionally treated with platinumbased chemotherapy, the patient was treated with salvage cisplatin and irinotecan. These agents were selected as cisplatin gains superior central nervous system penetration and irinotecan has been used in this setting on primary brain tumors. Given the toxicity associated with the selected regimen, a long was held with the patient prior to initiating therapy. Initially, the patient responded well both clinically and radiographically to therapy; however, surveillance imaging at weeks demonstrated significant tumor progression . Following , platinumbased chemotherapy was discontinued as the tumor demonstrated resistance, and salvage therapy with bevacizumab was undertaken.

Biopsies of the skin lesions were taken. This prompted genetic testing on the patients colonic adenocarcinoma, which revealed a mutation in the MSH2 gene, rendering the patient with a diagnosis of MTS. The patient presented to neurosurgical attention in with complaints of unsteady gait along with episodes of transient paresthesias involving the left arm, torso, and leg. His immediate family history included a deceased sister with a history of an astrocytoma and deceased mother with colon cancer; genetic testing was not performed on either. The patient exhibited no neurologic deficits. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI studies revealed the presence of a welldemarcated, right posterior parietal mass roughly in diameter. The tumor appeared as an isointense signal on the T1weighted image with enhancement after administration of gadolinium contrast , and as a hyperintense signal on the T2weighted image. Computed tomography CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was negative for masses. Given the patients history and the need to determine whether the brain mass represented a metastatic lesion from his previous colon cancer or a primary brain tumor, the patient initially underwent an MRIguided, frameless stereotactic biopsy of the enhancing margin of the brain lesion for histologic diagnosis. Pathology revealed scattered atypical glial cells with monosomy of chromosome in some of the cells. A distinct classification was unable to be determined. Therefore, roughly weeks following the biopsy, the patient underwent an imageguided, awake right parietal craniotomy for resection of the tumor. The surgery proceeded without complication and the patient was discharged to home with no new neurological deficits on postoperative day one. The pathological report from this specimen definitively proved the tumor to be a glioblastoma multiforme World Health Organization WHO grade with positive immunohistochemical staining for p53 and GFAP and a Ki proliferative index of . Immunostaining for the mismatch repair proteins MSH2, MLH1, and MSH6 revealed that the tumor lacked staining with MSH2 and MSH6 with intact staining for MLH1, suggestive of a germline mutation.

The tumor exhibited a significant mass effect, causing compression of the 4th ventricle, resulting in obstructive hydrocephalus of the 3rd and lateral ventricles, as well as causing tonsillar herniation of mm. A CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed no evidence of malignancy. The patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent insertion of an external ventricular drain followed by imageguided suboccipital craniotomy for grosstotal resection of the cerebellar tumor. Neuropathological examination of the resected tumor revealed a glial tumor comprised of Glial fibrillary acidic protein GFAPpositive astrocytic cells, some of which appeared to show fibrillary cytoplasmic processes. Rare examples of eosinophilic granular bodies and Rosenthal fibers were also found. Mitotic figures were scarce, and MIBKi67 was estimated at . Vascular proliferations were also seen. In light of these findings, the tumor was histologically felt to be consistent with diffuse astrocytoma with highgrade features, as shown in . Molecular analysis of the tumor did not reveal a BRAF V600E mutation or BRAF fusion but interestingly revealed MYBL1MMP16 fusion. No mutations in IDH1, H3F3A, H3F3B, or TP53 were detected. TERT promoter mutation was not found, and ATRX immunohistochemistry showed retained expression in the tumor cells. A postoperative MRI done four months after surgery showed a small infiltrative residual tumor behaving like a diffuse glioma . One year later, the patient presented again with progressive ataxia. CT and MRI of the head completed at this time revealed a mass measuring x in the right cerebellar hemisphere. In addition, there was a x lesion in the right cerebellar peduncle with an enhancing cystic component in the 4th ventricle . There was also associated herniation of the cerebellar tonsils and compression of the 4th ventricle with resultant hydrocephalus. The patient underwent emergent insertion of an external ventricular drain followed by redo suboccipital craniotomy for stealthguided resection of both of these lesions. Neuropathologic examination of the recurrent tumor also revealed an astrocytic tumor with morphological features similar to the original tumor. Unlike the initial tumor, the recurrent tumor also revealed focal evidence of infiltration and more frequent mitotic activity, with counts reaching highpower fields. MIBKi67 proliferative index was also greater at . Molecular studies were performed on the recurrent tumor and revealed the same MYBL1MMP16 fusion as in the initial tumor.

Clinical context extracted from a report of a similar case presented with neck pain, paresthesia in all four limbs, and difficulty in walking for year duration. This context helps to understand the patients clinical symptoms and the possible underlying causes, which can be useful in guiding the diagnostic process and treatment planning.","On neurological examination, the patient was paraplegic with absent deep pain perception in the pelvic limbs. The pelvic limbs had increased extensor tone, normal patellar reflexes, normal withdrawal reflex in the left, and decreased withdrawal reflex in the right. Pain was elicited on palpation of the lumbar spine. Findings were consistent with a lesion of the L4S2 spinal cord segments. Complete blood count and serum biochemistry panel and electrolyte analysis were unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI; T MAGNETOM Espree; Siemens of the thoracolumbar spine revealed a slightly rightsided, discrete, intramedullary mass at the level of the L3 intervertebral disk space; the mass occupied over of the vertebral canal . The mass was mildly hyperintense on T1weighted T1W images, moderately hyperintense on T2weighted T2W, and short tau inversion recovery images, and showed intense, homogeneous contrast enhancement Magnevist; Bayer. In addition, there was mild T2W and short tau inversion recovery hyperintensity within the spinal cord cranial to the mass, most consistent with spinal cord edema. Differential diagnoses included primary neoplasia lymphoma, nephroblastoma, ependymoma, or glioma and, less likely, granuloma. Thoracic radiographs were normal. A rightsided, L3 hemilaminectomy was performed, and a purplishbrown, approximately cm diameter mass was identified beneath the dura. There were prominent meningeal vessels, and following a durectomy, the mass was noticed to be highly vascularized around the margins and on the surface. Bipolar electrocautery was used to coagulate meningeal and peritumoral vessels. Initially, there was no clear plane of dissection between the mass and the surrounding spinal cord, so an ultrasonic aspirator Sonastar XSE, Aesculap, Center Valley, PA, USA was used to perform the initial dissection through the pia as well as the underlying, thin, vascular tumor capsule. Once the pia and capsule were removed, a plane of dissection was easily distinguished, and the mass was removed en bloc. On further gross examination, the mass was firm and appeared noticeably more vascular along the surface than on the inside. The dog was hospitalized and received standard postoperative care, including intravenous fluids and analgesia. At the time of dismissal from the hospital approximately h after surgery, the dog was nonambulatory paraparetic and was voiding voluntarily. On histopathological evaluation, the spinal mass was composed of mildly pleomorphic spindle cells arranged in loose streams and bundles separated by variable amounts of fibrillar stroma . The spindle cells had small amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm and irregularly oval nuclei; mitoses were rare. Throughout the neoplasm were numerous, often ectatic, haphazardly arranged capillaries lined by plump endothelium. Frequently surrounding the capillaries were perivascular aggregates composed of plasma cells and fewer lymphocytes. Immunohistochemically, the spindle cells and stroma were strongly and diffusely positive for neuronspecific enolase NSE and negative for factorVIII. The capillaries were diffusely factorVIII positive and negative for NSE. These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of hemangioblastoma. The dog was reevaluated at our institution months after surgery. Neurological examination revealed ambulatory paraparesis and proprioceptive ataxia in the pelvic limbs with the right limb being more severely affected. Postural reactions in the pelvic limbs were normal on the left and delayed to absent on the right. Spinal pain was not appreciated. Followup MRI performed months after surgery showed no evidence of tumor recurrence; however, spinal cord atrophy was present at the level of the excised hemangioblastoma. Hypointense material on precontrast T1weighted and postcontrast T1W with Fat Sat images was visible to the right of the atrophied spinal cord and corresponded to an area of mixed intensity on the T2W images. This material may represent CSF and adhesions within the vertebral canal secondary to atrophy of the spinal cord and surgery . The application of a chemical Fat Sat to the postcontrast T1W image but not to the precontrast T1W image made distinction of this tissue from the spinal cord more apparent.

He was evaluated for these symptoms and imaging revealed an enhancing mass AP x T x CC mm with central areas of cystic change within the left CP angle extending into the left internal auditory canal. The tumor was consistent with a vestibular schwannoma. It was decided to observe the tumor with repeat scans at timed intervals. He was scanned months later when he had an improvement in his symptoms, with imaging revealing a decrease in the size AP x T x CC mm. Continued observation was recommended with no intervention planned. Repeat imaging done months later revealed a further reduction in size AP x T x CC mm and conservative management was continued. About a year later, he had magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the brain done, which revealed a marginal increase in size AP x T x CC mm . About months later, reimaging showed that the schwannoma had substantially enlarged AP x T x CC mm . An audiometric evaluation at this time revealed a moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss in the left side. Speech discrimination scores were very poor at on the left side and on the right. The patient decided not to undergo any treatment and had a repeat scan months later that again showed a decrease in the size of the left acoustic neuroma AP x T x CC mm with internal acoustic canal IAC extension being stable at mm. There was neither hydrocephalus nor brain stem compression although the tumor was abutting the cerebral peduncle. He had decreased sensation over the left side of his face and no hearing on the left side, with gait imbalance and a sway to the left. The volume of the tumor was calculated using the formula AnteroposteriorAP x transverseT x craniocaudalCC and the trend in volume changes over time is depicted in . Although Kameyama et al. classified cystic vestibular schwannomas into three types based on MRI findings, we could not place the patient in a particular subgroup because MRI findings were suggestive of a transition between all three subgroups over a period of time, prior to treatment. It was at this time that we recommended intervening using stereotactic radiosurgery because we felt a smaller tumor would likely have the best balance between response and risk. We also discussed all the available treatment options including further observation and microsurgery. He underwent Gamma Knife radiosurgery and received Gy to the isodose line using shots with a conformality index of .

Tinnitus was less common , . Duration of symptoms before admission ranges from one month to years. Clinical findings included a mass that was present in the ear , , followed by purulent external auditory canal exudate , . see . Highresolution computerized tomography HRCT was obtained for of patients and magnetic resonance imaging MRI was acquired for of of the patients. All patients demonstrated a soft mass in the EAC. The masses ranged in size from to millimeter in greatest dimension mean, mm. The site of the tumors is summarized as follows: in six cases , the lesions were located only in the cartilaginous portion of the external auditory canal EAC; in one case , the lesion was located only in the bony portion of the external auditory canal EAC ; in one case , the lesion was originated from the cartilaginous portion with extension into the bony part of the EAC; in another case , , the tumor located in the cartilaginous portion and protruded out from the EAC. The tumor margin was well circumcised and confined in all cases. On temporal HRCT, all of the lesions exhibited isoattenuating soft tissue masses in the EAC, one mildly involved the tympanic bone . In one patient several calcification foci were found in the mass, and the mass showed heterogenous enhancement on the CT with the soft window. Seven cases were examined with MRI, six cases underwent contrastenhanced MRI, and DWI was performed in five cases. On T1WI, four cases demonstrated intermediate signal intensity, two cases showed mixture of intermediate and high signal intensity, and one case showed low signal intensity. On T2WI, four cases demonstrated high signal intensity, two cases showed mixture of intermediate and high signal intensity, and one case showed intermediate signal intensity. On contrastenhancement T1WI, three cases showed edge enhancement, two cases homogenous enhancement, one case heterogenous enhancement. On DWI of five cases, all tumors appeared as intermediate signal intensity, but in two of them high signal intensity of cholesteatoma was also found deep to the tumor in the EAC . showed that the tumor was adjacent to the parotid gland, however, the F revealed the tumor was originated in the EAC, there was a gap between the tumor and the parotid gland, and G revealed the integrity of the tumor capsule. Thus, the tumor did not contain any salivary gland tissue, and the tumor originated in the EAC See . On gross appearance, lesions appeared as solid masses, cases appeared as cysticsolid masses; the masses were round, ovale, or lobulated. According to the WHO classification of ceruminous neoplasms, nine cases were diagnosed as benign ceruminous adenoma.

She underwent a neurosurgical resection, and the pathology demonstrated glioblastoma. She then received weeks of external beam fractionated radiotherapy to , cGy cGy in fractions with concomitant daily temozolomide at m2, followed by adjuvant temozolomide m2 for days on a monthly basis. After cycles of adjuvant temozolomide, new cystic enhancement was discovered while performing a head MRI , and she was placed on of dexamethasone timesday. Bevacizumab was subsequently started at a dose of kg every weeks. After cycles of bevacizumab, there was only a partial decrease in the gadolinium enhancement and the size of the cystic tumor . She then came to our institution and her original histological diagnosis was confirmed. Additional pathology testing revealed a negative IDH1 immunohistochemical labeling but a positive OLIG2, EGFR amplification and methylated MGMT promotor status. Because TTFields interrupt tumor cells during mitosis and have no appreciable overlapping toxicity with bevacizumab, we proceeded to add to her bevacizumab treatment TTFields therapy using the NovoTTF100A device. Each cycle consists of weeks of continuous treatment. The treatment compliance was recorded by sensors, embedded within the transducer arrays and can be downloaded by computer for review in clinic visits. Her dexamethasone was weaned off after cycles of combined treatment. After a total of cycles of bevacizumab plus TTFields therapy, with a respective mean and median compliance of hours of the day and hours of the day range to h, there was a near complete resolution of gadolinium enhancement and a reduction in the size of the cystic tumor . However, there were also recurrent tumors detected in the left internal capsule and the medial left frontal brain , which were located outside of the prior radiation treatment fields. Therefore, the recurrent tumors were treated with fractionated CyberKnife radiosurgery to , cGy cGy in fractions. Despite this radiosurgery intervention, the patient continued to deteriorate neurologically and her deterioration was most likely caused by the microscopic invasive glioblastoma. She eventually died months after her first recurrence and months after initial diagnosis.

The tumor has a heterogeneous appearance with several foci of cystic change. The tentative diagnosis is medulloblastoma, and the differential diagnosis is ependymoma. Gross pathology of the tumor revealed a soft and grayred lesion. The tumor was circumscribed but the margin between the tumor and the dorsal side of the medulla was not very clear. Decompression of the tumor was done first to gain more working space, followed by the dissection of the tumor from the neighboring structures with extreme caution. The tumor was then removed in piecemeal fashion with the aid of Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator CUSA. The final pathology showed that the tumor was a malignant tumor, and the diagnosis was a germinoma. Based on the histological diagnosis, no abnormal enhancing mass lesion was observed in the whole spine MRI. Although her immediate postoperative brain MRI showed no evidence of abnormal enhancing mass lesion or abnormal leptomeningeal enhancement, she received postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy as a precaution. The radiotherapy protocol consisted of Gy on the tumor bed and Gy on the ventricle system. The patients postoperative clinical course was uneventful, and she is currently doing well on regular followup at the outpatient department.

The magnetic resonance imaging MRI scans of the head revealed the tumor present in the lateral part of the left temporal lobe and the cerebellum . After the total resection of the tumor, the samples were histopathologically evaluated. At the same time, a computed tomographic CT scan revealed diffuse tumorous lesions in the lungs. After resection, a biopsy was performed on one of the lesions. Frozen section of the lesion resected from the right lung was examined No . The specimen was measuring x x in size, which showed the presence of whitishgray nodules. The crosssection of the specimen revealed irregular and slightly brown infiltration. On microscopic examination, the specimen revealed bronchopneumonia with focal necrosis and fibrosis of the lung, which raised the suspicion of lymphoma. However, on further evaluation of the formalinfixed paraffinembedded sections, we observed many irregular necrotic areas, as well as fibrinous exudate with many macrophages and a few neutrophils in the alveoli . We also observed sparse giant multinucleated cells, lymphocytic infiltration around the blood vessel, and necrotic areas together with focal fibrosis. In some blood vessels, thrombi including organized ones were also revealed. Additional staining , namely, van Gieson, WarthinStarry, and azan were performed. Necrotizing pneumonia was ultimately diagnosed. Samples obtained from the posterior part of the left temporal lobe of the brain No: were small grayish and around in size. On microscopic examination, multiple focal points of infiltrations composed mainly of small T cells CD3 and macrophages CD68 with dispersed giant cells of ReedSternberg morphology were observed . The following immunophenotype of the aforementioned cells were revealed: CD45 , weaker than in T cells, CD30 , strong cytoplasmic and membranous, CD15 , weak cytoplasmic and in Golgi system in some cells, PAX5 , slightly weaker than in B cells, CD20 , membranous, weaker than in B cells, OCT , strong nuclear on the majority of the cells, BOB1 , trace in single cells, CD10 , Bcl6 , ALK1 , CD3 , S100 , and CD1a . Prognostic markers on Hodgkin and ReedSternberg HRS cells were as follows: Bcl2 , cytoplasmic, weaker than T cells, Ki67 , strong in almost all HRS cells, and CD68 in many concomitant macrophages category . Classical Hodgkin lymphoma cHL of the CNS, mixed cellularity subtype MCcHL was diagnosed. The samples from the brain were consulted and the diagnosis was confirmed. Correlation between the reactivation of EpsteinBarr virus EBV with the positive EBVLMP1 immunostaining was emphasized . Subsequently, the samples from the lung were reevaluated. A few slightly larger B cells CD20, CD30, CD15, and EBVLMP1 admixed with T cells CD3 were found . The final diagnosis was changed to grade LYG with lung involvement. In trephine biopsy No: lymphomatous infiltration of the bone marrow was not observed. Evaluation of the cerebrospinal fluid showed no abnormalities. The patient was HIV negative. The following systemic polychemotherapy was introduced: BEACOPP DepoCyte courses, radiotherapy Gy, and CHOP courses.

He denied changes in normal bowel and bladder function. He had been evaluated weeks prior at the same facility with similar but less severe complaints and diagnosed with bilateral sciatica. Workup during the more recent visit revealed an L2 mass invading the spinal canal for which the patient was transferred to our facility for neurosurgical evaluation . The patient had noted a left testicular mass years ago and stated that it had been enlarging in size and was painful to touch. He denied having ever brought this complaint to the attention of a physician. He also admitted to poor appetite and significant weight loss over the prior month amounting to pounds and attributed this to his major depression. He denied fevers, vision changes, night sweats, or any other palpable lesions or rashes. The patient was a pale, anxiousappearing male who was alert and cooperative, tachycardic, and hypertensive. He exhibited tenderness to palpation in the midline lumbar spine. Upper extremity strength was normal. Right hip flexion, knee extension, dorsiflexion, and plantar flexion were grade . The same motor groups were only at antigravity strength on the left side. Rectal sphincter function was normal. On sensory exam, saddle anesthesia was noted as was decreased sensation to light touch in a distribution that approximated the bilateral L2 and L3 dermatomes. His reflexes were grade throughout and no longtrack signs were observed. His left testicle was enlarged and a mass was palpable that was nontender at the time. A magnetic resonance image MRI of the spinal axis demonstrated a leftsided retroperitoneal mass that extended into the spinal canal at the L2 and L3 levels through the left L2 and L3 neural foramen with severe thecal sac compression at the L2 level . A scrotal ultrasound showed an echogenic region within the left testis with clustered microlithiasis suspicious for primary testicular neoplasm. Initial serum labs were remarkable showing the following levels: Sodium mmoll, alkaline phosphatase IUl, hemoglobin with serum iron level being mugdl and ferritin level of ngml, albumin , sedimentation rate mmh, and betaHuman Chorionic Gonadotropin , IUl. In the first h after admission, during his inpatient medical workup, the patients lower extremity motor exam deteriorated rapidly to less than antigravity bilaterally. A decision was made to urgently decompress and stabilize the spine, as well as obtain tissue diagnosis before the full metastatic workup had been completed. Bilateral laminectomies were performed from L1 through L3. Soft tumor mass was removed extradurally from within the canal, resulting in thorough decompression of the conus and cauda equina. Surprisingly, blood loss was not particularly bad and transfusion was not needed. Frozen intraoperative pathology was reported as metastatic carcinoma. As the amount of bone and tumor removed was likely destabilizing and the bone quality found to be poor at these levels, a posterolateral pedicle screw fusion was performed from T12 through L4 . Final histopathologic analyses revealed abundant tissue necrosis with an estimated live tumor cell presence of only . Immunohistological analysis indicated a final diagnosis of metastatic choriocarcinoma. Postoperative metastatic disease burden workup revealed that the retroperitoneal mass was actually x x and encased the aorta, splenic artery, the left renal artery, and vein. Also, there was extensive metastatic burden within both lungs and the liver. Free fluid was present within the pelvis. A contrasted MRI of the entire neuraxis revealed a hemorrhagic right occipital enhancing lesion, a nonenhancing subcortical left inferior frontal lobe lesion, and an enhancing C3 vertebral body lesion. Within h after decompression, the patients bilateral lower extremity strength and sensation improved. He was maintained on dexamethasone for cerebral and spinal edema. Subcutaneous enoxaparin and sequential compression devices were used to prevent thromboembolism. Chemotherapy was initiated on postoperative day and consisted of etoposide, ifosfamide, and cisplatin. On the same day that chemotherapy was started, his hospital course was complicated by acute respiratory failure secondary to a suspected pulmonary embolism. He was intubated and an inferior vena cava filter was placed to prevent additional emboli. He declined while intubated, requiring pressor support, and developed a large pericardial effusion which was drained via pericardial window. He was started on continuous renal replacement therapy, and his spouse elected to withdrawal care compassionately on postoperative day hospital day which resulted in death on the same day.",0.0,0.0441996464028287,0.7499451637268066,0.4203308224678039,0.1078748651564185,0.0172972972972972,0.0604099244875943

The patient was then advised to follow up with his primary care physician. The medication history of the patient was amlodipine orally once a day, atenolol orally once a day, and omeprazole once a day. He has a past surgical history of transurethral resection of the bladder TURBT. The patient denied associated systemic symptoms including hyperthyroidGravesrelated fatigue, increased respiratory effort, struggling to breathe myasthenic symptoms, and motor weakness stroke. A review of the systems was negative except for visual disturbance and tremors. On focused ophthalmic exam, intraocular pressures were OU and visual acuity was on the right eye and on the left eye. The remainder of the ophthalmic exam showed no abnormalities. On physical exam, the left eye was slightly more protuberant than the right eye. There was significant horizontal diplopia initially in the left visual field and vertical diplopia in the inferior visual field. All blood and chemistry panels including CBC, BMP, and CMP were all within normal limits at this time. An acetylcholine receptor antibody panel was also ordered to rule out myasthenia gravis as it could present as monoocular diplopia. Notably, serologies for EpsteinBarr virus were negative. Due to monoocular involvement, the possibility of systemic diseases that are more acute and emergent in nature such as stroke, posterior cerebral artery aneurysm, Graves disease, central demyelinating disease, and cavernous sinus thrombosis were determined to be less likely. Suspicion for orbital cellulitis was low as the patient denied any pain with extraocular muscle movement and experienced no photophobia. Additionally, retinal and vitreous detachments were deemed unlikely etiologies as their presentation is usually acute in nature, and our patient had been experiencing diplopia for one month. In order to rule out any intracranial and intraorbital pathology, an MRI was determined to be the next step in the evaluation of the orbit and soft tissue structures around the left eye. An outpatient MRI brain showed a nasal mass within the ethmoids with intracranial extension 1D. The recurrent nature of the diplopia and MRI finding of a nasal mass indicated the need for flexible fiberoptic nasal endoscopy. Findings included no masses, lesions, polyps, or pus on the right side. The left side presented with a fleshy mass filling the middle nasal meatus on the medialtemporal side, but not obstructing the nasal airway. No overlying mucosal ulceration or areas of bleeding. Clear white drainage was present throughout. There was no appreciable change after employing the Valsalva maneuver, including no noticeable pulsations or expression of clear fluid. The mass appeared to extend posteriorly within the ethmoid cavity, leaving the inferior turbinate intact. The nasopharynx was clear and the sphenoethmoid recess contained some edema. A CT sinus landmark without IV contrast was obtained to properly evaluate the bony anatomy surrounding the nasal mass and determine the course of surgical management 2D. A complex mass centered in the region of the left ethmoid air cells measuring in diameter was incompletely evaluated due to the lack of IV contrast and better evaluated from the prior MRI. The mass extended and destroyed the medial left orbital wall, impinging on the orbit as well as the inferior left frontal lobe. The differential diagnosis included squamous cell carcinoma, esthesioneuroblastoma, and atypical infection of fungal etiology. Obliteration of the left ethmoid air cells by the mass resulted in occlusion of the left ostiomeatal unit as well as the frontoethmoidal and sphenoethmoidal recesses, causing opacification of the frontal, sphenoid, and maxillary sinuses. The patients rhinorrhea was determined to be cerebrospinal fluid leakage as the nasal mass appeared to be a peripheral enhancing, mostly cystic lesion seemingly originating from the ethmoid sinus and cribriform plate with intracranial extension into the left frontal lobe with some associated edema. Due to intracranial involvement, neurosurgery was consulted and an endonasal biopsy was done to identify the mass as either an encephalocele or mucocele versus a cystic tumor. The biopsy revealed a highgrade malignant neoplasm, a favorably sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma. He underwent bifrontal craniotomy for tumor excision and had a neartotal resection of the intracranial portion and repair of the cribriform plate. Repeat MRI revealed complete resection of intracranial extension and likely acutesubacute infarct in the medial left occipital lobe 3D. He was extubated on postoperative Day . The hospital course was complicated due to right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis for which he was given enoxaparin and switched to apixaban prior to discharge. Final management consisted of the radiation oncology recommendation that the patient follow up in three to four weeks. Our patient remained asymptomatic for seven months until he returned with diplopia and obtained an MRI, revealing tumor recurrence.",0.0368564532906087,0.1756572133734864,0.7872626781463623,0.299986,0.3188180404354588,0.0700934579439252,0.1601866251944012

The patient gave a poor history regarding her visual loss but denied acute changes in vision over the weeks preceding admissions. No cutaneous lesions were identified. The absolute lymphocyte count ALC was muL. Other laboratory values, including a detailed endocrinology panel, were within normal limits. Computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance MR imaging were obtained. MR imaging of the orbital and nasal region demonstrated a homogenous and wellcircumscribed mass, with mild homogenous enhancement and mild restricted diffusion Figure 2a. The lesion expands both nasal cavities and extends intracranially through the cribriform plates and through the clivus into the prepontine cistern. The mass encased the right cavernous carotid artery and exert mass effect on the optic nerve and chiasm. Enlarged retropharyngeal lymph nodes Figure 2b and upper level IBII lymph nodes were observed. Maxillofacial CT scan confirmed the MR imaging findings and bony erosion of the anterior clivus, bilateral medial sphenoid bones, and left clinoid process. A staging positron emission tomography PETCT showed hypermetabolism in the tumor tissue. Endonasal biopsy of the mass yielded specimens that showed histologic and immunohistochemical findings diagnostic of an ALK ALCL and .

The tumor did not lead to occlusion of the foramen of Monro, but ventricular enlargement had been observed years before and had worsened, reaching an Evans index of d. Magnetic resonance imaging MRI T2WI captured small intratumoral hemorrhages from the beginning of the followup a, b and c. Three years before, at the same time as the onset of ventricular enlargement, low intensity of the whole tumor and cerebral surface was observed on T2WI d. Subsequent followup revealed that this hemosiderin deposition had spread to the brain stem and cerebellar surface, and the ventricles had further expanded e. A hearing test revealed bilateral sensorineural hearing impairment, which is a permanent symptom of SS. The timed up and go test before and after the cerebrospinal fluid CSF tap test in the presurgical evaluation showed improvement in gait disturbance, suggesting responsiveness to CSF diversion. On the other hand, CSF analysis demonstrated xanthochromia, a white blood cell WBC count of mul normal range muL, and protein level of dL normal range dL and 2a. The CSF opening pressure was H2O normal range H2O. This result suggested that persistent bleeding from intraventricular tumors led to the development and exacerbation of SS and nonobstructive NPH. He was then advised to receive treatment for the tumor and was referred to our hospital after years of followup of the tumor. The patient wanted to have the tumor surgically removed. Tumor resection was performed through a right frontal craniotomy. Visual inspection revealed that the ventricular wall turned yellowishbrown, suggesting deposition of hemosiderin on the ependyma . The tumor surface was a mixture of yellow and red, suggesting the presence of hemorrhage at different times . The tumor was completely removed en bloc by dissection from the septum pellucidum. Histopathological findings were consistent with those of subependymomas. Although the tumor surface color suggested that multiple hemorrhages in different phases and slight microbleeding changes were observed in the tumor, Elastica van Gieson staining did not reveal any significant disruption of the tumor blood vessels . During the postoperative course, MRI revealed total tumor removal and no postoperative complications f. Postoperative CSF was drastically improved, being crystal clear, WBC count of mul, and protein level of dL b. However, ventricular enlargement and NPHrelated symptoms did not improve. Therefore, an LP shunt was performed for NPH weeks after tumor removal. Unfortunately, he developed shunt malfunction and infections weeks after surgery without any improvement.

Negative were reported in the following CSF etiological investigations: polymerase chain reaction for tuberculosis, bacteria and fungi cultures, India Ink stain for Cryptococcus, and IgG and IgM antibodies targeting various viruses and parasites. CSF cytology studies did not reveal neoplasm and chest CT and abdomen CT scans did not indicate any abnormality. Tuberculous meningitis was suspected and treated with isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. Meanwhile, brain ventricular puncture and drainage were performed and this dramatically attenuated the headache symptoms. The extraventricular drainage device was removed after weeks and shortly thereafter the patient suffered from generalized tonicclonic seizures. Once the seizures were controlled, a ventricularperitoneal shunt was placed, resulting in an improvement of the patients symptoms. Antitubercular therapy was given for months, and then it was discontinued once it proved to be ineffective. In January , the patients severe headaches returned and her CSF pressure reached mmH2O. Apart from a further decrease of glucose , her CSF analysis remained essentially unchanged. The brain MRI at this time revealed a round mass in the quadrigeminal cistern, multiple cyst signals in the Sylvian fissures, and the dilated cortical sulci in addition to the lesion in left thalamus. Overall contrast enhancement was present in the cerebral meninges, the cerebellar tentorium, the cyst walls, and the quadrigeminal cistern . The ventricularperitoneal shunt pressure was adjusted to mmH2O and stereotactic biopsy of the left thalamus was performed. However, the infiltration by a few lymphocytes was the only observation. The patients condition deteriorated as generalized seizures became more frequent. In April , she was transferred to our hospital. Upon admission, abnormal neurological findings included confusion, slow light perception, limited abduction of both eyes, grade IV of muscle strength of the right arm, general hyperactive tendon reflexes in both legs, positive Babinskis sign on the right side, and positive meningeal signs.

At the age of , the patient underwent surgical treatment for cerebellar hemangioblastoma. She also had a spinal cord hemangioblastoma at 11th thoracic vertebra level, a renal cyst and multiple pancreatic cysts . When her father underwent surgical treatment for a cystic cerebellar hemangioblastoma at our hospital International University of Health and Welfare Atami Hospital, she visited our hospital, at the age of , because of recently developed visual disturbance. Her visual acuity decreased gradually and her visual filed became narrow. The visual acuities at the first visit to our hospital were on the right side and sensus luminis on the left side. The examination of her left ocular fundus showed a pale papilla . Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of the head showed a Gdenhanced wellcircumscribed mass on the left retrobulbar optic nerve in the orbital, and threedimensional MRI showed the tumor enveloped the left optic nerve . The differential diagnoses for the tumor include optic glioma, optic sheath meningioma, optic nerve schwannoma and optic nerve hemangioblastoma. Among them, since the patient is a VHL patient, the most probable diagnosis was thought to be an optic nerve hemangioblastoma. Therefore, we made a decision to treat the tumor with stereotactic radiosurgery. At Shonan Fujisawa Tokushukai Hospital, the stereotactic radiosurgery was prescribed with the dose being Gy fractions using Novalis. The planning target volume was set at mL, and D95 of standard irradiation volume was set at Gy fractions. The patient completely lost her vision after the radiosurgery. Eighteen months after the radiosurgery, the tumor volume slightly decreased , but her vision has been still lost.

The sonographic appearance of the bilateral kidneys was normal. A kidney biopsy revealed class III lupus nephritis with inflammatory cell infiltration in the interstitium and glomeruli. No crescentic lesions were observed . One day after readmission, she complained of a severe headache and lost consciousness. Speech and cognitive functions could not be assessed due to a loss of consciousness. Her pupils were equally reactive to light bilaterally. Babinskis reflex was absent. Brain computed tomography CT revealed a masslike lesion measuring approximately , with midline shifting in the left frontal lobe. Brain MRI revealed a large intraaxial heterogeneous mass with a prominent hemorrhagic component, perilesional edema in the left frontal lobe, and remote lesions in both frontoparietal lobes and 2B. However, magnetic resonance angiography revealed no abnormal findings in the cerebral arteries. Considering the possibility that increased brain pressure due to large brain lesions on brain imaging modalities may cause cerebral herniation after lumbar puncture, we did not perform the CSF examination. Under the suspicion of brain tumor or CNS lupus based on the findings of brain lesions on CT and MRI images, we decided to perform a brain biopsy. After the brain biopsy, speech and cognitive impairments and paralysis of right upper and lower extremities were detected. The brain biopsy showed necrotizing vasculitis of the small and mediumsized arteries, leading to hemorrhages and leukocytoclastic vasculitis .

She was scheduled to receive six cycles of cyclophosphamide treatments, but due to severe leukopenia, rituximab treatment was added twice after four cycles of cyclophosphamide treatments. After induction therapy with steroid pulse, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab treatments, maintenance therapy with mycophenolate mofetil MMF and tacrolimus was initiated. Because her leukopenia persisted despite stopping cyclophosphamide treatment, tacrolimus day, which is known to induce leukopenia less frequently, was added to low dose of MMF gday. After induction therapy, SLEDAI2K score improved by up to . After three months of treatment, her neurological symptoms resolved without any sequelae. Four months later, followup brain MRI showed a reduction in the size of mass, without new lesions and 2D. She has been on a followup in the outpatient clinic for months without a flareup. Her urine proteincreatinine ratio declined to less than mg without microscopic hematuria and antidoublestranded DNA antibody turned negative.

There was also no evidence of lactotroph differentiation by ultrastructural analysis. After surgery, PRL levels were controlled without cabergoline, no glucocorticoid replacement was necessary and clinical and hormonal control was obtained. Four years later, the patient presented with typical, albeit sporadic, signs and symptoms of Cushing syndrome CS paralleled by intermittent hypercortisolism, indicating potential cyclic CS. Exogenous intake of glucocorticoids was strongly denied by the patient. A progressive worsening of the clinical features of CS was evident, with the onset of diabetes and hypertension .

These revealed a UTC level of mug h RV mug h and a suppressed morning serum cortisol level mugdL normal up to mugdL, in contrast to the previous . The psychiatric evaluation did not identify any mental disorder, although the psychological evaluation identified a complex familial relationship, especially involving her father, who had a history of alcoholism and had left home when she was a teenager. The patient presented a fragile ego, with predominant defense mechanisms of projection, negation, somatization and reactive reactions. Before the result of UFC, bilateral adrenalectomy was suggested to the patient in order to control the hypercortisolism, and the patient agreed to the treatment despite all the risks, showing a desire to get healthy and to be pregnant as soon as possible. During hospitalization and despite the multidisciplinary treatment approach, the patient showed persistent hypercortisolism and high levels of triglycerides, amylase and lipase. Abdominal CT at this time showed bilateral atrophic adrenal glands and severe pancreatitis, and since she had low cortisol laboratory values, a hydrocortisone stress dose was administered.

The data at that time were as follows: growth hormone GH, ngml; insulinlike growth factor IGF, , ngml; prolactin PRL, ngml. In addition, enlargement of pituitary fossa was observed in head Xray, and thickening of heel pad was observed in foot Xray. Based on these findings, she was diagnosed as acromegaly and hospitalized in our institution for further examination and treatment. On admission, her height and body weight were and . Blood pressure and heart rate were and bpm. Body temperature was C. Swelling of superciliary arch, hypertrophy of nose and lip, macroglossia, lower jaw protrusion, thickening of the plantar, enlargement of the palm and bitemporal hemianopsia were observed all of which were compatible with acromegaly. There were no abnormalities in heart and lung sound and in abdomen. The data on admission were as follows: GH, ngml; IGF, , ngml; free triiodothyronine FT3, pgml reference range: pgml; free thyroxine FT4, ngdl ngml; TSH, muUml. Other endocrine hormone levels were within normal range: adrenocorticotropic hormone ACTH, pgml; cortisol mugdl; dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate DHEAS, mugdl; plasma renin activity PRA, ngmlh; plasma aldosterone concentration PAC, pgml; luteinizing hormone LH, mUml; follicle stimulating hormone FSH, mUml; PRL, ngml; estradiol, pgml; testosterone ngml. Thyroidrelated antibodies including antiTg antibody, antiTPO antibody and thyroid receptor antibody were all negative. Liver and renal function was within normal range. Inflammatory and tumor markers such as Creactive protein CRP, carcinoembryonic antigen CEA and colorectal carcinoma CA19 were also within normal range. In thyroid echography, both lobes of the thyroid gland were swelling although increase of blood flow was not observed . In brain magnetic resonance imaging MRI, there was a giant tumor x x mm around pituitary fossa, pressuring on optic chiasm from the middle . Bilateral internal carotid arteries were surrounded by the tumor, and infiltration into the cavernous sinus was observed. Based on these findings, we finally diagnosed her as pituitary adenoma producing GH and TSH at the same time. After such diagnosis of GHoma and TSHoma, pituitary tumor resection was performed. Most of the tumor was resected during the pituitary surgery, although we fail to show what percentage of the tumor was resected. In hematoxylin and eosin HE staining of the resected pituitary adenoma, solid proliferation of chromophobe cells was observed Figure 2A . In CAM5. staining, many cytokeratinproducing cells were observed Figure 2B . In MIB1 staining, percentage of MIB1positive cells was about , indicating that the proliferative activity was relatively low Figure 2C . Based on these findings, she was pathologically diagnosed as sparsely granulated somatotroph adenoma. In GH staining, many GHproducing cells were observed Figure 2D and in TSH staining, many TSHproducing cells were observed Figure 2E , whereas in prolactin staining, prolactinproducing cells were not detected at all Figure 2F . These findings further confirmed our diagnosis that this subject had pituitary adenoma producing GH and TSH simultaneously. After the surgery GH level was markedly decreased although it was still higher compared to its normal range reference range in our institution: ngml. After the surgery, IGF level was also markedly decreased and became within normal range reference range in our institution: ngml . About year later, IGF level was increased again. After then, cyber knife therapy and treatment with somatostatin analog octreotide were performed. After the cyber knife therapy together with octreotide, IGF was marked decreased and became within normal range . However, since digestive symptoms were observed after the octreotide treatment, we started a combination therapy with GH receptor antagonist and octreotide based on the previous reports. After then, GH and IGF levels did not increase at least for years . After the operation, since thyroid function was not sufficiently suppressed, we started antithyroid drug thiamazole. After then, thyroid function was normalized and we stopped thiamazole. But TSH, FT3 and FT4 levels did not increase at least for years .

T1weighted contrastenhanced magnetic resonance imaging MRI showed an enhancing mass with intracranial and extracranial cystic components and in diameter, respectively . Although detailed information related to the previous surgery and radiotherapy was not available, a semiurgent surgery was planned because two of the cystic lesions were growing rapidly, and the patients symptoms continuously worsened after admission. The surgical procedure was performed in the right semilateral position under general anesthesia. The scar of the previous operation was reincised, preserving a frontal branch of the superficial temporal artery. An additional skin incision was made around the subcutaneous mass lesion, and an islandshaped portion of skin and temporal muscle covering the subcutaneous mass was left intact on the tumor side. The surrounding skin flap was then flipped, and artificial bone constructed during the previous surgery was observed on the vertex side of the tumor . A small bone window was made just above the artificial bone using a highspeed drill. Subsequently, a continuous narrow craniectomy approximately in width was performed surrounding the tumor and the artificial bone . This procedure was carefully performed using a ruler to maintain the safety margin of the tumor and to avoid tumor cell dissemination. A dural incision surrounding the tumor and the previous artificial bone were made using the space created by the narrow craniectomy . The middle meningeal artery, one of the main feeders of the tumor, was coagulated and cut during this procedure. The temporal bone, dura mater, and intracranial tumor were lifted gradually, and the branches of the middle cerebral artery and the cortical veins were carefully detached from the mass lesion. Subsequently, en bloc resection of the tumor with adjacent skin, temporal muscle, skull, dura mater, and a thin slice of the temporal lobe cerebral cortex was achieved . After completion of hemostasis, the dura mater defect was reconstructed with fascia lata, and the temporal bone defect was reconstructed with artificial bone Cemex Bone Cement, Tecres S.p.A., Italy. After repeated intraoperative tissue expansion of the adjacent scalp using a balloon in a French Foley catheter Figures 3a and b, a local rotation skin flap was created on the dorsal side of the skin defect Figures 3c and d. The skin defect was covered with this rotation skin flap and the expanded surrounding scalp, and a primary closure of the skin of the head was achieved . The temporal bone defect was shown to be adequately reconstructed with artificial bone on postoperative CT imaging Figure 4c. No residual tumor was identified on postoperative T1weighted contrastenhanced MRI . Histological analysis revealed that the tumor was comprised atypical spindle cell components with focal cartilaginous differentiation . The tumor was diagnosed as an OS, though the nature of the sarcoma remains unknown. Her symptoms, including aphasia and right hemiparesis, gradually improved within months, and she was discharged from our hospital with no neurological deficits. Because a CT scan of the body revealed no evidence of tumor metastasis, and her blood test showed a mild leukocytopenia of unknown origin leukocyte, micro; neutrophil, micro; and lymphocyte, micro9, she was carefully observed in the outpatient clinic without postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy.

The lesion on the right CPA side measures x x mm, while the lesion on the left CPA side is smaller, measuring approximately x x mm. The mass shows isointensity on T1T2weighted images and slight hyperintensity on T2weighted fluidattenuated inversionrecovery FLAIR images. The MB has restricted diffusion on diffusionweighted imaging DWI. Diagnosis: The patient was initially suspected of having a posterior fossa lesion, which could have been a lymphoma or bilateral CPA schwannoma. However, the subsequent pathological analysis revealed a tumor that displayed the features of the classic variant of medulloblastoma with small polymorphic hyperchromatic cells with carrotshaped nuclei, surrounded by scanty cytoplasm and neuroblastic rosettes. The Ki proliferation index was less than . Possible treatments, therapies, or management options: The patient underwent a right retrosigmoid craniotomy, followed by biopsy of the right cerebellar and right CPA lesions. She also received external beam radiation therapy to the craniospinal axis at a dose of Gy for weeks, with a boost to the posterior fossa at a dose of Gy for weeks, and chemotherapy with temozolomide and irinotecan. The MRI after radiotherapy and chemotherapy revealed no significant tumor growth but rather an apparent decrease in size. Eight months after biopsy, the patient continued to be free of neurological deterioration and showed improvement of diplopia and ataxia. The medical diagnostic report should be written in professional medical language suitable for clinical documentation.","An emergency department CT scan of the head revealed cerebral hemorrhage in the right cerebellar hemisphere and vermis . The of the examination were as follows: the right cerebellar hemisphere slice images with T1weighted , T2weighted , and FLAIR Figure 1g signals were confusing. On the second day of hospitalization, MRI and head examination findings were significantly enhanced. A T1weighted hyperintense and tiny patch of enhancement was visible in the center of the enhanced dissected lesion, while slightly longer T2weighted edema with blurred boundaries was visible at the periphery of the lesion . Right cerebellar MRI revealed a tumor with hemorrhage as an aberrant signal. Chest CT of the left subpleural lobe revealed a welldefined subpleural mass with somewhat less uniform density and slightly less uniform enhancement following contrastenhanced CT . After discussions with radiologists and neurosurgeons, it was decided that lungoccurring brain metastases were more probable. The patient underwent right hemisphere tumor resection and external ventricular drainage because of a headache that progressively worsened throughout hospitalization, and a change in consciousness from lucid to lethargic. We first inserted a right frontal horn external ventricular drain, which allowed us to reduce intracranial pressure during surgery by releasing cerebrospinal fluid and expanding the surgical space, taking into consideration the patients gradual increase in intracranial pressure. This prevented the brain tissue from swelling after the skull was opened surgically as well as the development of severe swelling during surgery. Intraoperatively, the tumor appeared fleshy red, mushy, and hypervascular, with peritumoral hematomas. The tumors excision size was approximately x x , and there was no clear separation between the tumor and the surrounding brain tissue. Although it was not clear whether the tumor was a highgrade meningioma during the operation, the fact that the tumor was hemorrhagic made us more cautious; we excised the dura that was adherent to the tumor and used an artificial dura to reduce the tension and suture it. We considered that the patient was hemorrhagic from the tumor, and decompression was performed using a debulking flap. Postoperative CT of the head was performed . A malignant mesenchymal brain tumor right cerebellar mass was resected, with extremely diverse, and markedly mitotic cells HPF. The immunohistochemical findings were as follows: s , a positivity rate of KI, H3K27ME3 , CD34 , Vim and STAT; the postoperative pathological findings are shown in . The lesion was classified as an anaplastic meningioma WHO III. When comparing the pathology of head and lung cancers, meningioma metastases to the lung should be considered for left lung tumors identified using needle biopsy : Vim, Ki positivity , TTF1, and CK. One week after treatment, the patient was transferred to a hospital closer to home for ongoing rehabilitation, and he underwent postoperative CT of the head . Two months later, a telephonic checkup revealed that the patient had recovered well.",0.0313642628772278,0.1673720882863309,0.8286373615264893,0.55667496,0.3351648351648352,0.0771349862258953,0.1593406593406593
